# FlowersForPollinators

Software for the identification of the most significant combination of plants useful for certain pollinators
The software will use only data from open available dataset.


**Warning:**
The software is sitll under construction


### Currently used data soruces:

#### Plants - pollinators interactions data:

GloBI data, available under under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):

Poelen, J. H., Simons, J. D., & Mungall, C. J. (2014). **Global Biotic Interactions: An open infrastructure to share and analyze species-interaction datasets**. *Ecological Informatics*, 24, 148â€“159. [doi:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.08.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.08.005)

#### Plants phenology data:

Seems quite difficoult to find an open dataset of plant phenological data with a quality and variety at the level of GloBI.

Exist the PEP725 project (http://www.pep725.eu/) but the access is subordinate to the registration and single autentication for the results of each query.

For the moment we will limit the area of phenological data at USA using the USA Nathional Phenology Network https://usanpn.org/data/overview wich seems to allow an easy exploration through web API



## NOTES and TO DO
### TO DO
We should remember to chekc the nomenclature used for the plants, we can follow the suggestions of Plant Phenology Ontology https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ppo
